Double exponential smoothing, also known as Holt's method, is a forecasting technique that extends simple exponential smoothing by incorporating a trend component, making it suitable for time series data with a linear trend but no seasonality. 
Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:
How it Works:
Level and Trend Components:
Double exponential smoothing estimates both the level (the average value) and the trend (the rate of change) of the time series. 
Two Smoothing Parameters:
It uses two smoothing parameters:
α (alpha): Determines the weight assigned to the level component. 
β (beta): Determines the weight assigned to the trend component.
